We have to slect the model for our Dataset, so we are applying all Regression Models on ours Datasets and then selecting best regression model for our dataset on basis of r_squared co-efficient. The best model will have r_squared co-efficient closest to one.

Data.csv is the dataset for model selection. This dataset is cleaned and numeric, so we don't have to pre-process it.

The r_squared co-efficients of All Regression Models are given below:

Multiple Linear Regression:  0.6261395942654089
Polynomial Regression:       -6.578577187538827
Support Vector Regression:   0.7450019881733005
Decision Tree Regression:    0.6164510413712425
Random Forest Regression:    0.8101939940507101

Hence, according to r_squared co-efficent: Random Forest Regression is best regression model for this dataset Data.csv.
